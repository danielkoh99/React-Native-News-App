# React-Native-News-App
This is my first app built with React Native, which pulls data from a third party API to get the news in Hungary, and in different categories. Users can share the news with anyone they would like, or view the news in a webview. There is also some basic data visualisation with the coronavirus data.

Here is a drive link if you want to try out the app:
Download the file, then just press on it and the app will install.
